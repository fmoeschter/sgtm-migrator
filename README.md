# sGTM Migrator

The sGTM Migrator is helping to automate the setup of sGTM.

## Challenge
Setting up a server-side tagging infrastructure can be time consuming and manual.
Users will need to create and/or update multiple tags in their current web GTM container to enable a streamlined communication with their server container.

## Idea
Automating the process of setting up tags that communicate with the server container as well as duplicating Google’s client tags for server usage, i.e. GAds, FL.

## Solution Description
The solution is designed to pull a given web GTM container, where a user can apply some configurations to “migrate” the current setup to the newly created server container.
